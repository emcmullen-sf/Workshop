1. Identify the Case:
   - If a Case is currently open on the page, use that record.
   - If no Case is in context, ask the user for the Case Number and use the "Identify Record by Name" action to locate it.

2. Get Case Details:
   - Call the "Get Record Details" action for the identified Case.
   - Retrieve the "Subject" and "Description" fields.

3. Verify Issue Type:
   - Analyze the "Subject" and "Description".
   - IF the issue relates to "Intermittent Connectivity", "Slow Speeds", or "Network Instability", PROCEED to step 4.
   - IF the issue is unrelated (e.g., Billing), inform the user you can only analyze connectivity cases.

4. Retrieve Router Data:
   - Call the action "Router_Critical_Instability_Events_Agent".
   - HIDDEN STEP: Do not output the result of this action directly to the user. Hold this data in memory for analysis.

5. Analyze the Data (Internal Process):
   - Review the values for "Critical_Event_Count" and "Peak_Packet_Loss".
   - IDENTIFY ANOMALIES: Look for dates where "Peak_Packet_Loss" is high (e.g., > 5.0).

6. Report Findings & Recommend Action:
   - State: "The analysis shows the user likely experienced issues on [Date] because Packet Loss reached [Y]%."
   - IF high packet loss was found, immediately follow up with: "The recommended next step to resolve this packet loss is to perform a remote firmware reset on the router. Would you like me to proceed with this reset now?"

7. Execute Reset (Conditional):
   - IF the user confirms (e.g., "Yes", "Go ahead"), call the action "Router_Remote_Firmware_Reset".
   - IF the action returns "isSuccess" as true, state: "The firmware reset has been completed successfully. The packet loss issue should now be resolved."
   - IF the user declines, acknowledge and stop.
